# Get started coding with zero configuration

## Using Visual Studio Code

1. [Install Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
1. Open project directory in VS Code
1. Press F1, and select `Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container...`
1. Wait a few minutes as it pulls image down and builds Dev Conatiner Docker image (this should only need to happen once unless you modify the Dockerfile)
    1. You can see progress of the build by clicking `Starting Dev Container (show log): Building image` that appears in bottom right corner
    1. During the build process it will also automatically run `mix deps.get`
1. Once complete VS Code will connect your running Dev Container and will feel like your doing local development
1. If you would like to use a specific version of Elixir change the `VARIANT` version in `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`
1. If you would like more information about VS Code Dev Containers check out the [dev container documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/create-dev-container/?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5003399)
